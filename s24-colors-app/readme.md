# Smart Palette Manager

This is my version of Colt Steele's long exercise in his [Modern React Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/modern-react-bootcamp/), which in turn is based on apps like [Flat UI Colors](https://flatuicolors.com/) and [Material IU Colors](http://materialuicolors.co/?utm_source=launchers).

I added my own customisations, most notably a "smart" auto color button for the _Create Palette_ section.
